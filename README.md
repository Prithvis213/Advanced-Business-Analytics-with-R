# Advanced-Business-Analytics-with-R
Final semester project details for the university course "Advanced Business Analytics with R"

The main aim of this project is to predict whether an applicant of a specific loan can repay the loan or not.
There are many cases of defaults due to applicant’s inability to repay for many reasons. 
Another side, we have a case of applicants who struggle to get loans due to bad or non-existent credit histories.
Such people get excluded from the financial system and hence, get taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. 
There is therefore a need for more sophisticated algorithms predicting an applicant’s ability to repay 
based on a variety of alternative data. I am using data from a Kaggle competition that was hosted by Home credit,
an NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company) based in the European Union.

The first part was the feature Engineering to gather the data together and obtain the final feature matrix.
